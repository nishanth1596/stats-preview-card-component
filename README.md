## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Through this project, I improved my skills in:

1. **React Component Structure**
2. **CSS Modules**
3. **Responsive Design:**
4. **Reusable Components**

### Continued development

Since this is a small project, I didn't create too many components, but for larger projects, I plan to create multiple components and use props to make them more reusable. I would also like to continue practicing more complex layout techniques, especially working with Flexbox and Grid

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs - Flexbox - This documentation helped me understand Flexbox better.
Google Fonts - I used the Outfit font from Google Fonts to style the text.
